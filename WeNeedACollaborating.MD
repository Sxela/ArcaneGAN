Hello Alex,

Excuse me for contacting you by this uncommon way.

We are working on an R&D task for filmmaking. For a better visual of our film, we need to create our own Film Art Style.

- You can take a look about some result here
    
    [This Result is done by EBSynth and your ArcaneGAN AI filter. (ArcaneGAN created key-frames for EBSynth generation)
    ](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b625cbc0-68f8-464d-9337-c41125985c20/077b08a1-7f69-4f2d-af72-e936a661f5e9/EffectControl_on_Render_1_H.264.mp4)

So what we need is a business with you on a large project for building a filter like what you did to the ArcaneGAN filter, but now the Art Style will be defined by our paints.
